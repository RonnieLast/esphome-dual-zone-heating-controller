# esphome-dual-zone-heating-controller

First github project, so bear with me.

This is the YAML for a heating controller based on ESPHome and an ESP32 control board with four relays. 
It's designed for an S-plan dual zone and domestic hot water ("dhw") system with individual relays to control the zone relays, and one spare.
